# Learning Clojure

A list of resources that I've found helpful learning the Clojure programming
language as a noob. These resources should be particularly helpful if you're a
developer who is unfamiliar with Lisp-like languages and/or JVM hosted
languages. 

## Books & Ebooks

- [Clojure for the Brave & True](https://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/) - a
  fantastic, beginner friendly, interactive walkthrough of the language for very beginners

## Videos

- [Clojure in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-kF25fWTO8) - Short
  lecture like walkthrough of the language at a high level, capped with some
  live coding
